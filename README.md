# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Debugging Misconfigurations

This repository demonstrates a scenario leading to uncommon errors when using the Expo CLI. The errors aren't directly caused by the CLI itself but rather by misconfigurations within the project's setup, particularly mismatched or conflicting dependencies. The primary challenge lies in effectively tracking the source of the problem through careful log analysis.

## Scenario:

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file illustrates a project with potential issues (e.g., incompatible package versions, missing dependencies, or incorrectly configured build settings in `.expo/config.json`).  The error is intentionally vague, simulating the challenges of diagnosing subtle issues in real-world Expo projects.  The project might not start or might throw unexpected errors during development or building.

## Solution:

The `uncommonExpoSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the project, highlighting the steps needed to identify and resolve the underlying issues. This includes carefully inspecting the error messages, checking the project's dependencies using `npm ls` or `yarn why`, ensuring the dependencies are compatible, and double-checking the project configurations in `package.json` and `.expo/config.json`.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to run `expo start` or build the project. This should cause an error.
4. Review the provided solution to identify and correct the issue. 

This example intends to help developers better understand how to diagnose and solve obscure Expo CLI issues, which frequently result from subtle project misconfigurations rather than the Expo CLI itself.
