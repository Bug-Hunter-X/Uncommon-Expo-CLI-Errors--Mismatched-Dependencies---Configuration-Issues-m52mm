This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  It's particularly uncommon because it often stems from misconfigurations within the project's `package.json`, `.expo/config.json` or mismatched dependencies, rather than a bug in the Expo CLI itself. The error message itself may not be explicit, often manifesting as build failures, unexpected behavior during development, or the inability to run the project using `expo start`.  Debugging often involves carefully checking the logs for hints at the root cause, often involving a deeper investigation into the interactions between various packages and their versions within the project's dependency tree.
